        <p>As a full stack web developer, I successfully designed and developed a Python Django e-commerce website. 
            Leveraging my expertise in Python, Django, and front-end technologies, I created a robust and user-friendly platform that offers seamless online shopping experiences.</p>
                
    
    
        <ul>

            <li>Designed and implemented a responsive and user-friendly front-end interface, incorporating HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to enhance the user experience.</li>
            <li>Utilized Django's Model-View-Template (MVT) architecture to develop robust back-end functionalities, 
                including user authentication, product catalog management, shopping cart functionality, 
                and secure payment integration.</li>

            <li>Implemented database models and utilized Django's Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) to interact with the database and handle data persistence.</li>    
            <li>Integrated third-party APIs, such as payment gateways(razorpay) and shipping services, to facilitate seamless transactions and order fulfillment.</li>
            <li>Implemented best practices for security, including input validation, encryption of sensitive data, and protection against common web vulnerabilities.</li>
